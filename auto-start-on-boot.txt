Yes, this method will still work on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B with ARMv7l architecture running Ubuntu 32-bit 20.04 OS. The steps to create and configure the systemd service remain the same. Here's a quick recap tailored to your specific setup:

1. **Create the systemd service file**:

   Open a terminal and create a new service file for your project.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my_python_project.service
   ```

2. **Define the service**:

   Add the following content to the file, adjusting the paths and the Python interpreter as needed.

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=My Python Project
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/project/main.py
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project
   StandardOutput=inherit
   StandardError=inherit
   Restart=always
   User=pi

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   - **ExecStart**: Make sure this path points to your Python interpreter. Typically, it is `/usr/bin/python3` on Ubuntu.
   - **WorkingDirectory**: The directory where your project is located.
   - **User**: The user under which the script should run. Replace `pi` with your username if different.

3. **Reload systemd**:

   Reload the systemd manager configuration to recognize the new service.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. **Enable the service**:

   Enable the service so that it starts automatically at boot.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable my_python_project.service
   ```

5. **Start the service**:

   Start the service immediately.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start my_python_project.service
   ```

6. **Check the service status**:

   Check to make sure the service is running correctly.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status my_python_project.service
   ```

7. **View logs for debugging**:

   If there are any issues, view the logs to debug.

   ```bash
   journalctl -u my_python_project.service
   ```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that your Python script has execute permissions. You can set this with `chmod +x /path/to/your/project/main.py`.
- If your script requires any environment variables or specific environment setup, you can add those to the service file under the `[Service]` section using `Environment="KEY=VALUE"` or `EnvironmentFile=/path/to/envfile`.

This approach should work seamlessly on your Raspberry Pi 3 Model B running Ubuntu 32-bit 20.04 OS.
